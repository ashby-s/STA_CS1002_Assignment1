# CS1002 Assignment 1 Project 

The aim of this assignment was to produce a program that can be used by the user for two different purposes, which can be selected at the start of the program.

The first purpose is to let the user input the number of cups, tablespoons and teaspoons, and the program will output the total amount of cups, tablespoons and teaspoons in one line using the correct format and plurality, such as omitting the measurement and cups for situations where the number of said measurement is 0.

The second section of the program is where the user can input a number of millilitres to be used, and the program will use the measurement to separate this value in the cups, tablespoons and teaspoons required to hold this amount. This then uses the first purpose of the program to display the measurement using all the required units, cups, tablespoons, and teaspoons.

## Result

This Assignment was graded as a 17.5 of 20, a First-Class Grade, passing 150 out of 150 unit tests provided.
